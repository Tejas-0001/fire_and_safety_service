Mechanical Foam fire extinguishers, also known as AFFF (Aqueous Film Forming Foam) extinguishers, are effective tools for tackling fires involving flammable liquids (Class B) such as petrol, oil, and diesel. They work by forming a blanket of foam over the fuel surface, which helps to smother the flames and prevent the fire from spreading.These extinguishers contain a foam-forming solution that is expelled from the extinguisher as a foam spray when discharged. The foam works by cooling the fuel surface and suppressing the release of flammable vapours, thereby extinguishing the fire and are suitable for use in a variety of environments, including industrial facilities, garages, workshops, and warehouses.",

GETECH Make CO2 (Carbon Dioxide) fire extinguishers are highly effective tools for tackling fires involving flammable liquids (Class B) and electrical fires (Class C). They work by displacing oxygen and smothering the fire, effectively cutting off its fuel source.These extinguishers contain pressurised carbon dioxide gas stored in a cylinder. When discharged, the CO2 gas expands rapidly, creating a cold discharge that helps to cool the fire and suffocate it by displacing oxygen.CO2 fire extinguishers are typically identified by their distinctive black color coding and are suitable for use in environments where other types of extinguishers may cause damage, such as computer rooms, laboratories, and electrical substations. They leave behind no residue, making them ideal for protecting sensitive equipment and materials.",

These extinguishers are highly effective at rapidly cooling the fuel source and extinguishing the fire.Water fire extinguishers typically contain plain water or water mixed with an additive to enhance its firefighting capabilities, such as a wetting agent or antifreeze solution. When discharged, the water is expelled from the extinguisher as a strong stream or spray, which helps to saturate the burning material and reduce its temperature, thereby suppressing the fire, suitable for use in various environments, including homes, offices, schools, and industrial facilities. However, they should not be used on fires involving flammable liquids, gases, or electrical equipment, as water can conduct electricity and may exacerbate these types of fires or pose an electrical shock hazard",
